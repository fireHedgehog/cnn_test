# LeNet-python
### A tiny implementation of LeNet (without deep learning framework)

- - -
## Instructions
The main functional code is in LeNet.py.
To run the code, you should do the following:
1. Download the MNIST dataset and extract it to "your/path/to/data"
2. modify the data path to "your/path/to/data" in fetch_MNIST.py
3. execute "python LeNet.py"

Note: Python 2.7 is used to execute. Also, if something goes wrong, it is probably because of the incompatible version of numpy.
